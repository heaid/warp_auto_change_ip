# warp_auto_change_ip

## Describtion
This is a script for warp.

You can use it to change your IP of warp which was blocked by Netflix.

## What's more
Most of the code comes from the streaming media detection script of lmc999, thank you very much!

At present, it is possible to lock the region (for example, if the Singapore IP is locked, the IP will be changed again after being assigned to the Japanese IP until the IP is Singaporean).

After the changeing is completed, it will continue to monitor (every 10s, you can change it by yourself), and you can put it on the screen for background execution.

If you need one-time use, change sleep 10 to break.

You'd better use the range of IPv4 of 193, it can better unlock the streaming media, if he is not clear, please use my script to install warp.

## How to use
ipv4
```bash
wget https://github.com/heaid/warp_auto_change_ip/raw/main/warp_change_ip.sh && chmod +x warp_change_ip.sh && ./warp_change_ip.sh
```
ipv6
```bash
wget https://github.com/heaid/warp_auto_change_ip/raw/main/warp_change_ip.sh && sed -i "s/-fs/-6fs/g" warp_change_ip.sh && chmod +x warp_change_ip.sh && ./warp_change_ip.sh
```
PSï¼šWill use the result of directly executing curl to Netflix as a benchmark.
